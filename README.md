Hello everyone.
I've been trying to learn and improve myself on AI so newly.</br>
In this repositorie, I would like to share what I learned and I've been learning about Linear Regression.</br>
There are 2 types of Linear Regression examples here.First one is quite basic and second one is about </br>
how we can read csv file and how we can implement it into our linear regression model.

This example is very basic linear regression model’s visualization.
